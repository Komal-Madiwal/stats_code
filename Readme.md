## Z-Test

<!-- The z-test is a statistical hypothesis test used to determine whether there is a significant difference between a sample mean and a known population mean. It is particularly useful when you have a large sample size and know the population standard deviation. -->

### When to Use the Z-Test

<!-- You can consider using the z-test under the following conditions:

- When you have a sample size large enough for the central limit theorem to apply.
- When you know the population standard deviation.
- When you want to test hypotheses about population means. -->
